# Attention-based-Battery-Parameter-Augmentation-Technique-to-Alleviate-Limited-Data-Challenges

We aim to resolve the data scarcity issue by employing an attention-based technique
to generate reliable synthetic data. The generated data will greatly assist researchers
to develop reliable battery aging prediction models.

# Procedure to run this code- 

1. Click on code and download zip
2. Upload the file on your google drive
3. Open the file with zip extractor in the drive
4. Then click open Informer.ipynb file and follow the code each step
5. You can click open the file in colab and run the file only after the file is mounted in your drive
6. All changes to the Prediction Length, epochs, dataset, etc can be made in the run.py file 
7. Insertion of a new dataset must be done in the data folder as well as adding the data as a custom data in data_loader.py Line 192
8. You may make changes in the data set used and target to be run
